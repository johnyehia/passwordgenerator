# passwordgenerator
A password generator is a program that randomly generates passwords based on certain criteria, such as length, character types, and complexity. This project provides an example implementation of a password generator in Python, with some additional features to allow the user to customize the generated passwords and save them to a file.

The password generator is implemented as a Python script that prompts the user to specify the length of the password and which types of characters to include (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols). The script then generates a random password that meets the specified criteria and prints it to the console.

Optionally, the user can choose to save the generated password to a file, by specifying a filename when prompted. The password will be appended to the specified file.
